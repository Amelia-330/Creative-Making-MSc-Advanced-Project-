## Introduction

* The system uses the gesture recognition technology Handpose.Osc, combined with the interactive machine learning application Wekinator and C++ based visual development program Openframework. Provides an interactive image generator that gestures to control the spatial changes of graphics parameters.

## Design Motivation
 
* Hope to study the visual effect feedback of gesture interaction


  
## Project Goal

* 1. Create filters based on real-time gesture transformations.
* 2. Use machine learning to match photos with different styles of posters.
* 3. Output interesting visual graphic poster.
